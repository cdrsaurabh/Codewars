# Codewars
In  this repository I'm going to upload the questions which I'll be solving on codewars of Python language.
<pre>
Today is 09/07/2025, as I was exploring different websites and I today I got to know about codewars I was aware of leetcode but not codewars so, I explored it a little bit and I thought that it is going to help me a lot. So I started exploring it and currently I'm learning python so I thought to give it a try.


So today the first question which appeared on the screen(obviously as a fundamental beginners of python) was to take a number as a input and then form a number by arranging the digits of the number in descending order.
For eg: 
input: 6284.  output: 8642

## I've not completed this question yet but Tommorow I hope I can solve it on my own.
