# Codewars
In  this repository I'm going to upload the questions which I'll be solving on codewars of Python language.
<pre>


So today the first question which appeared on the screen was to take a number as a input and then form a number by arranging the digits of the number in descending order.
For eg: 
input: 6284.  output: 8642
</pre>
```python
printf("hello");
